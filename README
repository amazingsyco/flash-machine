About Flash Machine:

Flash Machine is an application to store SWF files and bookmarks. It's meant to provide a better environment geared towards playing Flash games. Ideally it will support controlling audio, so audio could be muted or played through headphones.

Dependencies:

- BWToolkit (http://brandonwalkin.com/bwtoolkit/), used for some UI controls
- Soundflower (http://www.cycling74.com/products/soundflower), used for controlling the audio

Installing:

To get started, git clone the repository to your Mac:

git clone git@github.com:amazingsyco/flash-machine.git;

Update the git submodules:

cd flash-machine;
git submodule init && git submodule update;

Then, build it with Xcode.

Hacking:

If you want to edit the NIB files, you need to install the ibplugin for the BWToolkit dependency. It can be built from the Xcode project in the Dependencies folder.
